This project for module 2 introduces the use of flow charts to graphically explan a system. Flowcharts are commonly used to represent programs, algorithms, or any ordered process in various disciplines. flowcharts and data flow diagrams are used to graphically describe the solution to a problem.

Flowcharts and data flow diagrams can be hand drawn or created using a number of software applications including Microsoft Word, Visio, LibreOffice, GoogleDOCS, and various web applications such as https://www.draw.io/.

The flow chart must have these steps.
a.	Run a basic python program
b.	Download weather data to a database.
c.	Query the weather data 
d.	Extract weather data from database into a comma separated file with python
e.	Cleanse weather data
f.	Use python data analytics modules to develop graphical models



The code will be written in the IDE replit.

The requirements for this code will be:
  1.	Ask the user to input their name, city, and the current temperature.
  2.  If the temperature is greater than 60 display a message “It is nice where you live”. (Please note, when asking the user for a number you need to convert the number to a different data type like integer or float ).
  3. Review the code below and feel free to add additional lines of code to this program. 
  4.  Run the program and enter in values for name, city, and temperature
